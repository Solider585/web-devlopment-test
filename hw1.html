<h1>Dogs are <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Amazing</span> and should be given Pets!</h1>
<h2>And, cats I guess too, otherwise it would make my friend <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">sad</span>, even though cats are mean :(.</h2>

<h3>My opinion of Dogs</h3>
<p>I consider dogs to be superior to cats as I have had by far better experiences with Dogs then I ever did with cats.
    and I will tell you why. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type:sqaures">
    <li>They were always friendly</li>
    <li>Sweeter</li>
    <li>Always welcomed pets</li>
    <li>Always happy to see me coming through the front door</li>
    <li>Never bitten me unless they were scared or playing rough with em.</li>
    <li>Very expressive</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a picture of my sweet dog</p>

<h3>My opinion of Cats</h3>
<p>I personally do not like cats much at all. I've only loved a single cat, and have liked 3 cats out of all the cats I have ever interacted with. Somewhere around 20 cats as a reference.
    My friend whom loves them often tries to change my mind of how I view cats with very little success. Before I met him I absolutely hated cats, except for the one cat I truly loved, may he rest in peace,
    but now I just do not like them but at the same time do not mind them if they are around me. I still do not trust them in the slightest though. This does not mean that cats are not cute because, they are and certainly can be
    adorable, espically the munchkin cat breed. The tiny little legs they have make them look so adorable that I would want to own one as a pet.</p>
<p>Here lemme provide a picture of what they look like:</p>

<p>As for reasons to give pets to a cat. I do not have any except that you should always boop their tiny noses if they ever approach you. But I will try to list a few reasons why you should pet them here:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:sqaures">
    <li>They are demanding pets by placing their tiny head in the palm of your hand</li>
    <li>hop on and lay on your lap</li>
    <li>tapping you very gently and rubbing their head againsst you</li>
    <li> doing what this little kitten is doing from this video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgfGiTA1pek">ClickHere</a>
